interval-training
=================

I wrote this in March 2013, and now that I'm taking AP Music Theory it seems relevant again. This is a pretty simple program that I used to learn the intervals. Some sample intervals are provided.

Uses [StdAudio.java](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdAudio.java.html) from Sedgewick and Wayne's *Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach*, which is [released](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) under the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
